# Password Generator 🔑

### **Project Description** 📜

This project is a simple password generator written in C. It generates random passwords of a specified length, containing uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.  The generated passwords are then saved to a file named "passwords.txt". This is useful for creating strong, unique passwords for various online accounts, enhancing security.

### **Installation Instructions** 💾

1. **Save the code:** Copy the provided C code and save it as a `.c` file (e.g., `password_generator.c`).
2. **Compile the code:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.  Compile the code using a C compiler (like GCC):
   ```bash
   gcc password_generator.c -o password_generator
   ```
3. **(Optional) Install a C compiler:** If you don't have a C compiler, you'll need to install one.  For example, on Debian/Ubuntu systems, you can use:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install build-essential
   ```


### **Features** ✨

* Generates random passwords of specified length.
* Includes uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols in the password character set.
* Allows the user to specify the number of passwords to generate.
* Saves the generated passwords to a text file ("passwords.txt").
* Provides error handling for invalid input (number of passwords and password length).


### **Usage Instructions** ▶️

1. **Run the executable:** After successful compilation, run the executable from your terminal:
   ```bash
   ./password_generator
   ```
2. **Enter inputs:** The program will prompt you to enter the number of passwords to generate and the desired length of each password.
3. **View output:** The generated passwords will be displayed on the console and saved to the `passwords.txt` file.


### **Dependencies** 🔧

* A C compiler (like GCC).
* Standard C libraries (`stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `time.h`).


### **Commands** ⚙️

```bash
# Compile the code
gcc password_generator.c -o password_generator

# Run the executable
